[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip) ![GitHub tag (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/jeffdemartino/PanethAnalysis)

The `PanethAnalysis` package provides the data and wrapper functions required to reproduce the analyses from our publication "Optimal human intestinal organoid model reveals interleukin-22 induced Paneth cell differentiation".

## Installation

The following non-CRAN dependencies need to be installed prior to PanethAnalysis:

``` r
# Bioconductor: DelayedMatrixStats, limma, destiny, slingshot
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install(c("DelayedMatrixStats", "limma", "destiny", "slingshot"))

# Github: SeuratWrappers
devtools::install_github('satijalab/seurat-wrappers')
```

You can then install the development version of PanethAnalysis from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jeffdemartino/PanethAnalysis", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Be sure to build the vignette upon installation (by invoking `build_vignettes = TRUE`, as shown above) so the usage guide is made available. Note that for the sake of convenience, the time/memory intensive steps have been pre-computed (see [here](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/12/08/precompute-vignettes/) for more details on how to replicate this).

As of this version (v0.1.0), all the required data sets are bundled in this package (\>200MB). This may change in the future when the data is made publicly available post-publication.

## Usage

The guide for using this package (i.e. reproducing the data analyses and figure panels) is available as a package vignette, which can be accessed by calling `browseVignettes("PanethAnalysis")` and selecting the HTML file.
